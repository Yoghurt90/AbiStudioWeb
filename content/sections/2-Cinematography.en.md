content: "Wedding cinematography is completely different from the old wedding video style. It puts the emphasis more on emotions. Our goal is to capture the most important moments of the day, in which a captured emotional moment gives back much more than a long uncut video. Finally, we select from these recordings the best moments and speeches made at your wedding and make a film with a cinematic experience. We use DSLR / MILC devices, which are similar to a movie in the visual world, as well as various special camera stabilizers to further enhance the experience."
