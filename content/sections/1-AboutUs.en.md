        "My name is Mihály Pusko, I am the founder of ABI studio, and I have been making films since 2011. I met the other half of my team through my work, and I’ve known Dani since I was a kid. I entered into the world of weddings in 2016 and have been in love with it ever since. My passion is filmmaking as I love telling stories and really enjoy the visual impact that making films has on setting a scene. I think that the most effective way to make sincere films is when we work quietly in the background, unnoticed, to portray the true emotions of people and their interactions with others. This is why I believe in refined aesthetics, and not in mundane special effects, when creating the final result.",
